# Assignment #5 Solution

## Problem 1a) and 1b)
### 15 points across 3 types of test:
* Base case test - did you test the initial state of your traffic lights?
* Edge case test - did you test changing one of your lights and making sure that triggers a change for the other light?
* Exception test - did you try to 'trick' the system into changing the value of a light and make sure it didn't work?

### Each of the three tests is worth 5 points:
* 1 point for a good precondition
* 1 point for a good postcondition
* Up to 2 points for execution - does what you're doing make sense?
* 1 point for overall readability of the test

## Problem 1c)
Should have at least 3 tests again. In this case there should be at least one test where the light changes after 90s, one test where the light changes back after 30s and at least one test where the light is expected not to change. The three tests will be graded the same way as described above.
